Change to internal functionality:

Change # 1:

	This change was a implimentation of our custom class.  Our new class is a
	"TeleportUnit".  It has the ability to move far in one move.  Aka it can move into a thing ring of a high radious aroundit. This class also does not drive around like other classes, it teleports around so we modified the update method in such a way that the movement animation was changed to a teleport animation.

Change # 2:

	This change is the implimentation of our two new unit types.  We have one land and sky based teleport unit.  He moves like the Teleport class describes but he cannot move onto water.  This unit has low health and is easy to kill, but hard to catch.  He is also a one hit kill on any unit but he has to be directly adjacent to the enemy to attack.

	The other unit we created is a water based teleporting submarine.  He moves and attacks like the ground unit only it cannot move/attack onto/units on land or in the air.  

Change # 3:

	We implimented the function "destroy_prob(attacker, defender, current_tile, turns)", which destroy_prob returns the an array of len(turns + 1).  Each k in the array is the 
	probability of destroying the defender in k turns taking into account defenses, tile 
	defense bonus, attack power and critical attack probabilities.  This function utilizes a helper function "nodal_prob(base_attack,crit_prob,turns,memo,health)", which
	Thinking of the probability of destruction at specific healths of the enemy
	as "nodes", this function computes the destruction probability for k turns.  It takes
	the base attack of the attacker, a dictionarry of the critcal values whose values
	are their probability.  It takes the turns you wish to compute for, an empty dictionarry
	memo for memorization and the health of the defender which would be the node 
	for which you specifically wish to compute probability for.



Change # 4:

	This change to the internal code is so that we can acomodate our new class "TeleportUnit".  We made the change because we decided that instead of causeing an
	enemy to blow up, teleporter units would use "Negative-Space-Implosion" to smite their enemies.  This mod allows the afffected functions to check class type and changes the die effect and sound accordingly based on the unit type.

		We added the attribute "kill_effect" to the base_unit. Normally the units would call a death_effect when killed, but we wanted to modify this so that when our teleport unit kills another unit it causes a blackhole effect. It should still be explosion by default.

		We simply replace .die_effect with .kill_effect

		if not atk_unit.active:
            # Add its death effect
            if self.sel_unit.die_effect:
                self._effects.add(self.sel_unit.die_effect(
                    self.map.screen_coords(pos)))

        if not atk_unit.active:
            # Add its death effect
            if self.sel_unit.kill_effect:
                self._effects.add(self.sel_unit.kill_effect(
                    self.map.screen_coords(pos)))
