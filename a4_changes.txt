Change to internal functionality:

Change # 1:

	This change was a implimentation of our custome class.  Our new class is a
	"TeleportUnit".  It has the ability to move far in one move.  Aka it can move into a thing ring of a high radious aroundit. This class also does not drive around like other classes, it teleports around so we took out the movement animation and added a teleport animation.

Change # 2:

	This change is the implimentation of our two new unit types.  We have one land and sky based teleport unit.  He moves like the Teleport class describes but he cannot move onto water.  This unit has low health and is easy to kill, but hard to catch.  He is also a one hit kill on any unit but he has to be directly adjacent to the enemy to attack.

	The other unit we created is a water based teleporting submarine.  He moves and attacks like the ground unit only it cannot move/attack onto/units on land or in the air.  

Change # 3:

	We implimented the function "destroy_prob(attacker, defender, current_tile, turns)", which destroy_prob returns the an array of len(turns + 1).  Each k in the array is the 
	probability of destroying the defender in k turns taking into account defenses, tile 
	defense bonus, attack power and critical attack probabilities.  This function utilizes a helper function "nodal_prob(base_attack,crit_prob,turns,memo,health)", which
	Thinking of the probability of destruction at specific healths of the enemy
	as "nodes", this function computes the destruction probability for k turns.  It takes
	the base attack of the attacker, a dictionarry of the critcal values whose values
	are their probability.  It takes the turns you wish to compute for, an empty dictionarry
	memo for memorization and the health of the defender which would be the node 
	for which you specifically wish to compute probability for.



Change # 4:
 
	#Q! put that stuff you changed here!!!!!! and delete the rest of this change

	This change to the internal code is so that we can acomodate our new class "TeleportUnit".  We made the change because we decided that instead of causeing an
	enemy to blow up, teleporter units would use "Negative-Space-Implosion" to smite their enemies.  This mod allows the afffected functions to check class type and changes the die effect and sound accordingly based on the unit type.


	documents edited: GUI.py

		within the GUI class we modified the method "sel_unit_attack()".  We edited
		the call to the function "atk_unit.hurt()" to accept a second perameter
		"self.sel_unit" (ie: the attacking unit object)

	documents edited: base_unit.py

		within the class "BaseUnit" we modified the method "hurt()" to accept a second
		parameter "attacker" (ie: the attacking unit object)

		Here is what we changed that method to:


			def hurt(self, damage, attacker):
		        """
		        Causes damage to the unit, and destroys it when it's out of health.
		        """
		        self.health -= damage
		        
		        if attacker.type == "Warper":
		            self.die_effect = effects.Wormhole
		            self.die_sound = "Wormhole"
		        else: 
		            self.die_effect = effects.Explosion
		            self.die_sound = "Explosion"
